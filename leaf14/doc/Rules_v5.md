# Overview

In Leaf & Let Die, players assume the roles of Gnome Gardeners, cultivating vibrant gardens filled with diverse botanical resources that will empower their central Plant Creature. Each garden is more than just a single plant—it's a thriving ecosystem where seeds, roots, and flowers interact, enriching the soil and environment to nurture a formidable Plant Creature. The player who best manages their garden's resources and cultivations will ultimately wield a powerful creature strong enough to defend the Gnome Colony in an epic botanical showdown.

Gameplay unfolds across two distinct yet interconnected phases: Cultivation and Battle.

In the Cultivation Phase, each Gnome begins humbly with a small supply of dice and cards, carefully growing their garden in their personal Planting Lab. Dice represent the Gnome's success at applying various cultivation techniques to nurture their Plant Creature. Players use their dice rolls to acquire Cultivation Cards that represent the capabilities of their developing Plant Creature.

Cultivation Cards are acquired through the Gnome's techniques and include various growth-enhancing botanical elements—such as Roots, Vines, Canopy, and Flowers. Each Cultivation Card has primary and matching abilities that synergize when combined with compatible resources or other Cultivation Cards, allowing players to strategically build powerful combinations in their garden.

Flower Cards are a special type of Cultivation Card that enhances powerful Bloom Cards used during the Battle Phase. 

Each card also possesses a Resilience Value, reflecting its durability when faced with damage during battle. This value becomes crucial in the second phase of the game—the Tangle Phase.

When all Flower Cards are acquired, the Cultivation Phase ends, triggering the start of the Battle Phase (also known as the Tangle Phase). During this transition, players can exchange their Flower Cards for powerful Bloom Cards, which enhance their Plant Creature's capabilities.

During the Tangle Phase, players' careful cultivation efforts come to fruition as their Plant Creatures battle each other directly. Dice now represent the combat power and tactical execution of the Plant Creature. Cards represent tactical botanical maneuvers—attacks and defenses that utilize the strengths developed during cultivation. Matching effects become critical in battle, empowering attacks or defenses through well-timed combinations of resources and plant characteristics.

Players are eliminated from combat when all their cards (representing the physical structure of their Plant Creature) or all their dice (representing its Energy or Health) are lost. The last player standing is the winner. 

Leaf to leaf, root to root, garden to creature—the Gnome who masters botanical synergy, resource management, and tactical finesse will emerge victorious, honored as the guardian of their colony's thriving future.

# Game Overview

### In *Leaf and Let Die*, players take on the role of industrious Gnomes cultivating a garden to nurture their **Plant Creature**, a botanical force they will later command in battle. The game unfolds in **two phases**:

* ### **Phase 1: The Cultivation Phase** – Players grow their supply of cards and dice in the Cultivation Grove.

* ### **Phase 2: The Battle Phase** – Players command their **fully grown Plant Creature**, using the cards and dice they cultivated to attack until only one player remains.

### Each decision in **Phase 1** determines how effective a player will be in **Phase 2**. The **last Gnome’s Plant Creature standing wins the game\!**

# Game Setup

## Cultivation Grove Setup

The Cultivation Grove is the central play area where players acquire Cultivation Cards and dice to develop their Plant Creature. The market is divided into three sections:

1. Flourish Types (Root, Canopy, and Vine)  
2. Wild Growth  
3. Bloom Potential

### Root, Canopy, and Vine Sections

Each of these *three* Flourish Types has *two* face-up stacks of available cards. Each stack contains *three* times *the number of players* in identical cards of a specific kind from its Flourish Type. This means you'll have *two* different kinds of cards per Flourish Type available in these face-up stacks, allowing players to focus on specific cultivation strategies.

### Wild Growth Section

This stack contains a mix of Root, Canopy, and Vine cards, shuffled together. It consists of *two* cards per player for each of the three Flourish Types, providing a third option for each type. The top card of this stack is always available for purchase, and on a player's turn, they may purchase the top card or discard it once to reveal a new option.

### Bloom Potential Section

Set up *three* Bloom displays, each representing a different way your Plant Creature might develop. Each display contains multiple Bloom cards placed face-up, along with a stack of Flower cards available for purchase. The number of Flower cards varies with player count:

* 2 players: 4 Flower cards per type  
* 3 players: 5 Flower cards per type  
* 4 players: 6 Flower cards per type

### Dice

Place the available dice (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20) in the dice supply box. The game works with any number of dice available as long as there isn't too little.

---

## **Player Setup**

Each player receives a **Player Garden Mat**, which has three distinct zones:

* **Supply (left side):** Contains the player’s reserve of cards and dice. Players draw from this zone when replenishing their hand.  
* **Planting Lab (center):** The active area where rolled dice are placed and used during turns. In Phase 2, this mat is flipped to become the **Tangle Field** for battle.  
* **Compost Bin (right side):** A temporary discard area for used cards and dice that are not permanently lost. When the Supply is empty, the Compost Bin is reshuffled into it.

---

### **Starting Resources**

Each player begins the game with:

* **2 D4s and 2 D6s.** The **2 D6s** are placed in the player's **Supply**. The **2 D4s** are rolled immediately and placed in the **Planting Lab**.  
* A deck of **Seedling cards**, from which the player draws **2 cards** into their hand, and draws **2 more** into their **Supply**.

Once this setup is complete, players are ready to begin **Phase 1: The Cultivation Phase**.

---

## **Determining Chain Order**

At the start of each round, all players total the pip values of their rolled dice. Players are then ranked from lowest to highest total to form the **Chain Order**, which determines turn order and targeting during card play.

### Tiebreakers

* **For First Place:** If two or more players tie for the lowest total (i.e., first in Chain Order), those players must choose one of their dice to reroll. After this is done, the chain order is evaluated again, and this process continues until there is one player who has the undisputed highest value.  
* **For Other Positions:** Ties not involving first place are resolved by proximity: the tied player closest **clockwise** from the highest-ranked player is considered higher.

### No Dice Rolled

If a player has not rolled any dice (e.g., they only drew cards), they are considered to have a total of **0** for the purposes of Chain Order.

---

## **Play Cards**

Starting with the highest-ranked player in Chain Order, players take turns playing cards in descending order.

* **Fixed Chain Order:** Chain Order is **fixed during card play**, even if pip totals change due to card effects.  
* **Tied Players:** If players are tied in Chain Order, the tie is broken by proximity: the player closest **clockwise** from the highest-ranked player goes first.

### Targeting Rules

When a card targets another player, it must target the **next lowest player** in Chain Order. The last player in Chain Order targets the **highest-ranked player**. This ensures that targeting follows the Chain hierarchy.

---

## **After Card Play**

Once all players have played their cards, **Chain Order is recalculated** before proceeding to the next phase. The recalculated Chain Order determines player sequence in the following way:

* **If entering the Cultivation Phase:** The new Chain Order determines the order in which players acquire cards from the available pool. This matters when card availability is limited.  
* **If entering the Battle Phase:** The new Chain Order determines the order in which players resolve damage and other combat effects.

Cards played may grant additional cards, dice, or interfere with other players’ resources.

---

## **Card Acquisition**

During the Cultivation Phase, once all card plays have resolved, players may acquire cards and dice in Chain Order. This is when you can strengthen your Plant Creature by adding new capabilities to your garden.

When acquiring cards, you have three main options. First, you can add to your garden's foundation by acquiring Flourish Cards; these are the Root, Canopy, and Vine cards that form the basis of your Plant Creature's abilities. You may acquire up to one card of each Flourish Type per turn, spending rolled dice that match the card's cost. These cards go directly to your hand, ready to be played in future turns.

Second, you can nurture your Plant Creature's potential by acquiring Flower cards. These special cards represent your creature's developing capabilities and are placed in your Bud stack, a separate deck that tracks your Plant Creature's growth. You may acquire one Flower card per turn, again spending rolled dice matching its cost. These cards will later be shuffled into your main deck during the Battle Phase, allowing your Plant Creature to fully bloom.

Finally, you can strengthen your cultivation techniques by acquiring new dice from the supply. To do this, spend pip totals equal to the die's number of sides; for example, spending 6 pips to acquire a D6. These new dice go to your hand, ready to be used in future turns.

When spending dice to acquire anything, you must use the full value of the die. You cannot split a die's value between multiple purchases. While card effects may modify these acquisition limits, you always have the option to acquire nothing on your turn if you prefer to save your resources.

* Chain Order determines the sequence of acquisitions  
* You may acquire up to one card of each Flourish Type per turn  
* You may acquire one Flower card per turn  
* You may acquire any number of dice  
* Card effects may modify these limits  
* You may choose to acquire nothing

## **Flower Cards and Bloom Potential**

During the Cultivation Phase, you can nurture your Plant Creature's potential by acquiring Flower cards. These special cards represent your creature's developing capabilities and are placed in your Budding stack \- a separate deck that tracks your Plant Creature's growth. Unlike other cards, Flower cards are not shuffled into your main deck during the Cultivation Phase.

Three unique Bloom types are available, each representing a different way your Plant Creature might develop. Each Bloom type has three associated Bloom cards and four Flower cards. When you acquire a Flower card, place it in your Budding stack. These cards will later be shuffled into your main deck during the Battle Phase, allowing your Plant Creature to fully bloom.

* Flower cards go to your Budding stack, not your main deck  
* You may acquire one Flower card per turn  
* Each player can receive up to two Bloom cards during the transition.

---

## **Transition to the Battle Phase**

### **Triggering the Transition**

The game transitions to Battle Phase when any **three** stacks of cards are exhausted. This includes any combination of Root, Canopy, Vine, Wild Growth, or Flower stacks. Once this occurs, the current round completes, and then the transition process begins.

### **Discarding Seedlings**

If a player still has any Seedling cards still in their deck, they are removed from the game.

---

### **🌸 Bloom Distribution**

During the transition to Battle Phase, each player receives exactly *two* Blooms based on their collected Flower cards. The distribution process is simple and straightforward.

First, each player counts their Flowers of each type. Then, they receive their Blooms based on these counts. If a player has Flowers of only one type, they receive two Blooms of that type. If they have Flowers of multiple types, they receive Blooms for their two highest Flower counts. In case of ties, such as having one Flower of each type, the player chooses which Blooms they want. A player must have at least one Flower of a type to receive its Bloom, and players who acquired no Flowers receive no Blooms.

Let's look at some examples to illustrate how this works. A player who focused entirely on one type, collecting four Flowers of Type 1, would receive two Blooms of Type 1\. Another player who pursued a mixed strategy, collecting three Flowers of Type 1 and two Flowers of Type 2, would receive one Bloom of Type 1 and one Bloom of Type 2\. A player who collected one Flower of each type could choose any two Blooms they want. And finally, a player who chose to ignore Flowers entirely would receive no Blooms.

The strength of a Bloom when played is determined by the number of matching Flowers you collected. While you can receive Blooms with just one Flower, collecting more Flowers of that type will make your Blooms more powerful. 

### **Entering the Battle Phase**

After all players have acquired two Bloom cards, the **Battle Phase** begins at the start of the next round.

At this point:

* Players will no longer use their dice to acquire cards and dice from the Cultivation Grove.  
* Each player flips their Planting Lab to the **Tangle Field** and begins play in Phase 2\.

### **Entering the Battle Phase**

After the Bloom distribution is complete, players prepare their Plant Creatures for battle. This is when all their careful cultivation comes to fruition. Each player takes their entire deck of accumulated cards, including their collected Flower cards, and combines it with their newly acquired Bloom cards. This combined deck represents their fully developed Plant Creature, with the Flowers now ready to bloom into their full potential. The deck is then shuffled and placed in their Supply, along with all their dice.

Each player flips their Planting Lab to become their Tangle Field, transforming their cultivation area into a battlefield. The dice that once represented cultivation techniques now become the energy and power of their Plant Creature in battle.

The game is now ready to begin the Battle Phase. Players will no longer acquire new cards or dice from the Cultivation Grove. Instead, they will use their carefully cultivated resources to battle each other, with their Plant Creatures' abilities fully bloomed and ready for combat.

## **Flowers and Blooms in Battle**

During the Battle Phase, Flowers and Blooms work together to create powerful effects. When you play a Flower card from your hand, you place it on your Flower Mantle; a special area that represents your Plant Creature's current bloom state. Unlike other cards, Flowers on your Mantle are not discarded during cleanup. They remain there until used by a Bloom card.

Bloom cards are powerful abilities that draw their strength from the Flowers on your Mantle. When you play a Bloom card, you can discard Flowers from your Mantle to enhance its effect. Matching Flowers (of the same type as the Bloom) count one-for-one, while non-matching Flowers count two-for-one. For example, a Bloom might say draw 1 die per Flower on your Mantle. So by discarding three matching Flowers you would pull 3 dice, or by discarding six non-matching Flowers, you would also draw 3 dice. An odd number of non-matching rounds down.

After a Bloom card is played and its effect is resolved, it is discarded to your Compost pile. The Flowers used to power the Bloom are also discarded. Any remaining Flowers stay on your Mantle, ready to power future Bloom cards. This creates interesting strategic decisions; do you use your Flowers now for a smaller effect, or save them for a more powerful Bloom later?

---

## **Applying Damage**

During the **Battle Phase**, instead of acquiring cards, players now **deal and receive damage**.

Starting from the **lowest player in Chain Order** each player receives damage from the next higher up in the Chain Order equal to their rolled pip value. The highest rank player would only take damage if they were subject to any thorn damage from the defending player.

If two or more players were tied for a position (which cannot have been the highest position, since that would have caused a reroll), the tied players are sorted according to the player which is closest clockwise to the first ranked player. In this situation it could be that a player may receive no damage since their next “higher up” in the chain is actually tied with them.

### **Absorbing Damage**

Damage must be fully absorbed using the cards and dice in a player’s hand. Players may use **any combination of cards and dice**, in any order.

* **Cards** absorb damage equal to their printed **Resilience** value.  
* **Dice** absorb damage equal to the number of **sides** they have.  
* All items used to absorb damage are **permanently removed** from the game.  
* If the damage exceeds the item’s resilience, another card or die must be used.  
* Even if more damage is absorbed than necessary (e.g., using a D20 to block 1), the entire item is still lost.  
* If the player cannot absorb the full amount, they **lose their entire hand**, but no damage spills into their Supply, Compost, or Bloom Site.  
* Flowers in the Bloom Site are discarded into the Compost if the entire hand is lost however.  
* Flowers in the Bloom Site are lost from the game when they are used to enhance a Resilience value on a card.

---

## New Round

At the end of a round, either during the Cultivation or Battle Phase, players discard their hand, both dice and cards, into their Compost Pile.

They draw **4 new items** from their Supply, either dice or cards, of any they wish and roll any dice.

Only when their Supply is completely bereft of all dice and cards, may they resupply it with all the cards and dice from their Compost Pile.

## Victory

A player is eliminated if they have **no cards** or they have **no dice** remaining.

The **last remaining player** is declared the winner.
