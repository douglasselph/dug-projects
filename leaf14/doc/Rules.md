# Leaf & Let Die - Game Rules

## Overview

In **Leaf & Let Die**, players assume the roles of **Gnome Gardeners**, cultivating vibrant gardens filled with diverse botanical resources that will empower their central **Plant Creature**. Each garden is more than just a single plant—it's a thriving ecosystem where seeds, roots, and flowers interact, enriching the soil and environment to nurture a formidable Plant Creature.

Gameplay unfolds across two distinct yet interconnected phases:

* **Cultivation Phase**: Players grow their gardens using dice and cards.
* **Battle Phase (Tangle Phase)**: Players command their Plant Creatures in battle.

The goal is to be the last player standing after all others have been eliminated.

## Game Phases

### Phase 1: Cultivation Phase

#### Game Setup

The Cultivation Grove is the central play area where players acquire Cultivation Cards and dice to develop their Plant Creature. The market is divided into three sections:

Root, Canopy, and Vine Sections
Each of these three Flourish Types has two face-up stacks of available cards. Each stack contains three times the number of players in identical cards of a specific kind from its Flourish Type. This means you'll have two different kinds of cards per Flourish Type available in these face-up stacks, allowing players to focus on specific cultivation strategies.

Wild Growth Section
This stack contains a mix of Root, Canopy, and Vine cards, shuffled together. It consists of two cards per player for each of the three Flourish Types, providing a third option for each type. The top card of this stack is always available for purchase, and on a player's turn, they may purchase the top card or discard it once to reveal a new option.

Bloom Potential Section
Set up three Bloom displays, each representing a different way your Plant Creature might develop. Each display contains multiple Bloom cards placed face-up, along with a stack of Flower cards available for purchase. The number of Flower cards varies with player count:
* 2 players: 4 Flower cards per type
* 3 players: 5 Flower cards per type
* 4 players: 6 Flower cards per type

Player Setup
Each player receives:

  * **Player Garden Mat**
  * **2 D4s (rolled to Planting Lab)**
  * **2 D6s (placed in Supply)**
  * **Seedling deck**: Draw 2 into hand, 2 into Supply

#### Chain Order

* Determined by total rolled pip values (lowest to highest).
* Ties: reroll or clockwise from highest.
* No dice rolled = pip total of 0.

#### Card Play

* Highest Chain Order plays first, then clockwise.
* Players play 1 card or pass.
* A player can only be targeted by one card at a time per round.
* Passing ends further card play that round.

#### Card Acquisition

During the Cultivation Phase, once all card plays have resolved, players may acquire cards and dice in Chain Order. This is when you can strengthen your Plant Creature by adding new capabilities to your garden.

When acquiring cards, you have three main options. First, you can add to your garden's foundation by acquiring Flourish Cards - these are the Root, Canopy, and Vine cards that form the basis of your Plant Creature's abilities. You may acquire up to one card of each Flourish Type per turn, spending rolled dice that match the card's cost. These cards go directly to your hand, ready to be played in future turns.

Second, you can nurture your Plant Creature's potential by acquiring Flower cards. These special cards represent your creature's developing capabilities and are placed in your Budding stack, a separate deck that tracks your Plant Creature's growth. You may acquire one Flower card per turn, again spending rolled dice matching its cost. These cards will later be shuffled into your main deck during the Battle Phase, allowing your Plant Creature to fully bloom.

Finally, you can strengthen your cultivation techniques by acquiring new dice from the supply. To do this, spend pip totals equal to the die's number of sides - for example, spending 6 pips to acquire a D6. These new dice go to your hand, ready to be used in future turns.

When spending dice to acquire anything, you must use the full value of the die. You cannot split a die's value between multiple purchases. While card effects may modify these acquisition limits, you always have the option to acquire nothing on your turn if you prefer to save your resources.

### Transition to Battle Phase

The game transitions to Battle Phase when any three stacks of cards are exhausted. This includes any combination of Root, Canopy, Vine, Wild Growth, or Flower stacks. Once this occurs, the current round completes, and then the transition process begins.

During the transition, each player counts their collected Flower cards by type. Each player receives exactly two Blooms based on their Flower counts. If a player has Flowers of only one type, they receive two Blooms of that type. If they have Flowers of multiple types, they receive Blooms for their two highest Flower counts. In case of ties, such as having one Flower of each type, the player chooses which Blooms they want. A player must have at least one Flower of a type to receive its Bloom, and players who acquired no Flowers receive no Blooms.

After the Bloom distribution is complete, players prepare their Plant Creatures for battle. This is when all their careful cultivation comes to fruition. Each player takes their entire deck of accumulated cards, including their collected Flower cards, and combines it with their newly acquired Bloom cards. This combined deck represents their fully developed Plant Creature, with the Flowers now ready to bloom into their full potential. The deck is then shuffled and placed in their Supply, along with all their dice.

The Garden Market is removed, as the Cultivation Phase has ended. Each player flips their Planting Lab to become their Tangle Field, transforming their cultivation area into a battlefield. The dice that once represented cultivation techniques now become the energy and power of their Plant Creature in battle.

### Phase 2: Battle Phase (Tangle Phase)

#### Flowers and Blooms in Battle

During the Battle Phase, Flowers and Blooms work together to create powerful effects. When you play a Flower card from your hand, you place it on your Flower Mantle - a special area that represents your Plant Creature's current bloom state. Unlike other cards, Flowers on your Mantle are not discarded during cleanup. They remain there until used by a Bloom card.

Bloom cards are powerful abilities that draw their strength from the Flowers on your Mantle. When you play a Bloom card, you can discard Flowers from your Mantle to enhance its effect. Matching Flowers (of the same type as the Bloom) count one-for-one, while non-matching Flowers count two-for-one. For example, if a Bloom requires three Flower power, you could either discard three matching Flowers, or six non-matching Flowers, or any combination that adds up to the required power.

After a Bloom card is played and its effect is resolved, it is discarded to your Compost pile. The Flowers used to power the Bloom are also discarded. Any remaining Flowers stay on your Mantle, ready to power future Bloom cards. This creates interesting strategic decisions - do you use your Flowers now for a smaller effect, or save them for a more powerful Bloom later?

#### Applying Damage

* Starting from lowest in Chain Order, players take damage from the next higher.
* Highest player takes damage from the one below.
* Damage = rolled pip total.

#### Absorbing Damage

* Use cards/dice from hand.
* Cards absorb damage = Resilience value.
* Dice absorb damage = number of sides.
* All absorbing items are lost permanently.
* Over-absorption still costs the item.
* If unable to absorb all damage:

  * Lose entire hand
  * Flower Mantle cards move to Compost
  * If used for absorption, Flower Mantle cards are lost permanently

#### New Round

* Discard hand (cards + dice) to Compost.
* Draw 4 new items from Supply (any combo).
* Roll dice.
* When Supply is empty, reshuffle Compost into Supply.

---

## Victory Conditions

* A player is eliminated if they have **no cards or no dice**.
* The **last player remaining** wins the game.

Happy Cultivating, and may your garden grow strong enough to win the Leaf & Let Die showdown!
