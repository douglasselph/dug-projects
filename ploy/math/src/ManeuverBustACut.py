    # Feature: You may reroll any one die. You must keep the second roll.

    # Bust A Cut Strategy rules:
    #   Given a set of dice of a variety of sides:
    #     - If all dice are greater than their EV then all dice values are kept.
    #     - If exactly one die is less than itâ€™s EV then that die is rerolled.
    #     - If multiple dice roll under their expected values (EVs),
    #       re-roll the one with the largest shortfall from its EV.
    #     - If multiple dice satisfy the condition of the last step (a tie),
    #       then choose the die with the largest number of sides
    #   The end result of any strategy is to keep track of a final totalled EV.
