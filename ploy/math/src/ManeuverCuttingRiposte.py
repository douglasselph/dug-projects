    # CuttingRiposte Strategy rules:
    #    The benchmark system we have doesn't have any explicit concept of an opponent's hand.
    #    So just rolling a d4 in order to determine which die is awarded (can be none).
    #
    # Old Feature: If your opponent has a D20, then gain a D10.
    # Or, if your opponent has a D12, then gain a D6.
    # Or, if your opponent has a D8, then gain a D4.
    #
    # Old Feature: Capture an opponent's die which you exceed and then reroll that die.
    #
    # Old Feature: Before the roll, downgrade the number of sides of one of your opponentâ€™s dice.
    # For example, a D20 to a D12, or a D12 to a D10.
