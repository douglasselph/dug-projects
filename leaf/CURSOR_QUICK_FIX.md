# Quick Fix for Cursor IDE "No tests" Issue

## The Problem
You're getting "No tests" when right-clicking on test files in Cursor IDE, even though the tests work perfectly via command line.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Install Required Extensions
In Cursor, install these extensions:
1. **Extension Pack for Java** (`vscjava.vscode-java-pack`)
2. **Kotlin** (`fwcd.kotlin`) 
3. **Gradle for Java** (`vscjava.vscode-gradle`)

### Step 2: Restart Everything
1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
2. Wait for Cursor to fully reload
3. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Java: Restart Language Server"

### Step 3: Verify Project Setup
```bash
./gradlew clean build --refresh-dependencies
```

## Alternative: Use Command Line (Always Works)

Since your tests work perfectly via Gradle, you can always run them from the terminal:

```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests "dugsolutions.leaf.player.PlayerTest"

# Run specific test method
./gradlew test --tests "dugsolutions.leaf.player.PlayerTest.pipModifierAdd_addsValueToList"
```

## Use VS Code Tasks in Cursor

You can also use the provided tasks:
1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task"
2. Select "Run Tests" or "Run Tests with Info"

## Why This Happens

Cursor IDE sometimes has issues recognizing Kotlin test structures, especially with Gradle projects. This is a known issue with Cursor's Java Language Server integration.

## Your Project Status

✅ **Tests compile correctly**  
✅ **Tests run successfully via Gradle**  
✅ **Project builds without errors**  
✅ **All dependencies are properly configured**  

The issue is **NOT** with your project - it's with Cursor's test recognition.

## Fallback Options

If Cursor continues to have issues:
1. **Use command line** - Always works perfectly
2. **Use Android Studio** - Your original setup works fine
3. **Use regular VS Code** - The configuration files are compatible

## Verification

To verify everything is working:
```bash
./gradlew test --tests "dugsolutions.leaf.player.PlayerTest.pipModifierAdd_addsValueToList"
```

This should run successfully and show test results.
