# Leaf to Legend: Game Rules

## Theme & Overview
In Leaf & Let Die, players become Gnome Gardeners cultivating vibrant gardens that nurture powerful Plant Creatures. Each garden is a thriving ecosystem where fruits, herbs, seeds, flowers, and roots interact to create a formidable botanical force. Players must master both cultivation and combat to emerge victorious as their colony's guardian.

## Core Game Flow
The game unfolds across two distinct phases:
1. **Cultivation Phase**: Players develop their gardens by acquiring cards and dice from the Garden Market
2. **Battle Phase** (The Tangle): Plant Creatures engage in tactical combat using their cultivated resources

## Components

### Cards
- Different Flourish Types:
  - Seedling (Starting cards)
  - Root
  - Canopy
  - Vine
  - Bloom
  - Special categories (Soil, Blight)

### Card Attributes
- Name
- Flourish Type
- Resilience (damage absorption value)
- Cost (in pips)
- Primary Effect
- Match Effect (triggered by specific conditions)
- Trash Effect (final effect when card is eliminated)

### Dice
- Available types: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20
- Each die's cost equals its number of sides
- Represents both cultivation resources and combat power
- Resilience value equals number of sides

### Player Components
- Player Garden Mat with three sections:
  1. Supply (Left) - Draw pile for cards and dice
  2. Planting Lab/Tangle Field (Center) - Active play area
     - Side 1: Planting Lab (Cultivation Phase)
     - Side 2: Tangle Field (Battle Phase)
  3. Compost Bin (Right) - Discard pile

## Game Setup

### Garden Market Setup
1. **Root, Canopy, and Vine Sections**
   - Two face-up stacks per type
   - 8 identical cards per stack
   - Only two different cards available per type

2. **Miscellaneous Stack**
   - Mixed Root, Canopy, and Vine cards
   - Two different kinds of each type (6 unique cards total)
   - Top card available for purchase
   - May discard top card once per turn

3. **Bloom Section**
   - 3 Bloom card stacks
   - (Number of players + 1) cards per stack
   - One type per stack
   - Includes Dormancy cards

4. **Bonus Dice Placement** (based on player count)
   - 2 Players: D20, D12
   - 3 Players: Add D10
   - 4 Players: Add D8
   - 5 Players: Add D6
   - 6 Players: Add D4

### Player Setup
1. Each player receives:
   - Player Garden Mat
   - 2 D4s and 2 D6s
   - Starting deck of Seedling cards

2. Initial Setup:
   - Roll both D4s into Planting Lab
   - Draw 2 cards
   - First player determined by highest D4 roll (D12 tiebreaker)

## Phase 1: The Cultivation Phase

### Turn Structure
1. **Use Dice & Play Cards**
   - Use Planting Lab dice for purchases
   - Play any number of cards from hand

2. **Acquire New Cards & Dice**
   - Purchase Cultivation Cards using dice pips
   - Buy new dice (cost = number of sides)
   - Limited to one card per Flourish Type per turn unless modified by effects

3. **Cleanup**
   - Discard used components to Compost Bin
   - Draw new hand (4 total items, any mix)
   - Shuffle Compost into Supply if needed

### Special Rules

#### Bloom Acquisition & Dormancy
- Maximum 2 Bloom cards per player
- Upon second Bloom, receive highest remaining Bonus Die
- Dormancy triggered after each Bloom:
  - Skip next turn
  - After Dormancy, move all Compost to Supply
  - Keep Dormancy card as Bloom counter

#### Card Effect Clarifications
- "Lowest die" means lowest-sided available
- Die upgrades follow sequence (D4→D6→D8→D10→D12→D20)
  - D12→D20 costs additional 8 pips
- Deflection negates damage without component loss
- Thorn damages attacker
- Retained components:
  - Set aside for next turn
  - Don't count toward hand limit
  - Dice retain current value

### Round Structure
1. **Determine Chain Order**
   - Ordered low to high by total pip value
   - Ties broken by highest-sided Bonus Die

2. **Play Cards**
   - Bottom-up order
   - Target adjacent chain positions only
   - Middle positions may target up or down

3. **Redetermine Chain Order**
   - Recalculate based on modified dice values

4. **Apply Damage**
   - Bottom-up processing
   - Damage = Difference in adjacent chain positions' totals

### Turn Order

#### Initial Game Setup & Cultivation Phase
1. **First Player Determination**
   - Each player rolls their initial two D4 dice
   - Player with lowest pip total goes first
   - Ties are broken by rolling a D12 (higher roll wins)
   - After first player is determined, play proceeds clockwise

2. **Cultivation Phase Flow**
   - Players take turns in clockwise order from first player
   - Each player may make purchases or pass
   - Phase continues until trigger conditions are met

#### Battle Phase
1. **Chain Position Determination**
   - Order is determined by total pip value (highest to lowest)
   - Ties are broken by highest single die value
   - Any remaining ties are broken by current chain position (lower position goes first)
   - Example: Player A (total 12, highest die 8) goes before Player B (total 12, highest die 6)

2. **Chain Resolution**
   - Combat resolves from bottom to top of chain
   - Players may only target adjacent positions
   - Middle positions may target up or down
