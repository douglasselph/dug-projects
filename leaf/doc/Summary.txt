Gnome Garden Game Design Summary (April 2025)

Overall Game Vision

Goal: Build a game where strategy, deck-building, dice-rolling, and combat phases blend into an evolving experience.

Theme: Players cultivate and grow their own plant-creatures through a dual-phase game (Cultivation Phase and Battle Phase).

Key Emphases:

Fun dice rolling

Meaningful deck-building choices

A strategic "build" arc followed by a tense "combat" arc

Avoidance of "dead" turns or "hopeless" games for players

Major Components

Players have Supply, Planting Lab (later Tangle Field), and Compost Bin.

Dice: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20

Cards are of five "Flourish Types": Seedling, Root, Canopy, Vine, Bloom

Phases

Cultivation Phase: Players grow their Plant Creature by buying cards/dice.

Battle Phase: Players use what they've grown to fight each other.

Chain Order System

Determined each round by pip total of rolled dice.

Tie-breaker is based on the First Player Token (gained during Chain setup).

Targeting during card play is limited to adjacent players in Chain Order.

Card play occurs one card at a time, highest pip total goes first.

Battle Phase Highlights

Players absorb damage with any mix of cards or dice.

No requirement that cards absorb damage first.

If a player can't absorb all damage, they lose their whole hand, but nothing from their Supply or Compost.

Victory by elimination (no dice or cards left).

Bloom and Transition Rules

Each player may only acquire two Blooms.

After second Bloom, player enters Dormancy (misses next turn).

Once two players have acquired second Blooms (regardless of player count), Transition Phase begins.

Remaining players are automatically awarded Blooms and Bonus Dice and go into Dormancy.

Post-Dormancy, normal gameplay resumes.

Dormancy in Battle Phase

A Dormant player:

May not play cards or roll dice

Has a pip total of 0

May still absorb damage if targeted

Returns to full play after Dormancy

Simulation Architecture

Baseline Player Setup

Starts with:

2D4, 2D6

4 Seedling Cards: 2x (AddToTotal +2), 2x (AddToTotal +3)

Can buy more of these simple Seedling cards

Prioritizes dice buying unless cards are needed for balance

Testing Player Setup

Same starting deck as baseline

Can purchase a "Test Card" (with the special effect being evaluated)

Simulation Metrics

Win Rate (Player B vs Player A)

Average pip gap at endgame

Lead changes per game

Game length

Testing Programs Recommended

Single Card Evaluation: 1 copy of Test Card

Multiple Card Access: 2 copies allowed

Late vs Early Insertion: Buy allowed after Turn 10 only

Cheap vs Expensive Simulation: Test effects at various acquisition costs

Card Effect Assessment Plan

Each effect tested should be scored by its:

Win rate improvement

Game acceleration/deceleration

Lead change influence

Pip gap narrowing or widening

Stronger cards cost more, but cheap cards with utility are also valuable.

Notes on "Draw 1 Die" Effect

Expected minor positive impact

Should be low-cost card (likely cost 2â€“4)

Simulation will validate impact
